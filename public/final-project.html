            Hi I'm John, a full-stack developer from Garden Grove CA. I'm currently attending the University of California Irvine in pursuit of my B.S. in Computer Science. As a student, I enjoy working out, playing video games, and hanging out with friends. As a developer, I prefer frontend development over backend due to my love for AngularJS and javascript frameworks but with the rise of Node.js backend development is starting to grow on me.
            </br>
            </br>
            Welcome to my personal site! The primary focus of this site is to portray my skills as a software developer to anyone who it may concern. Here you'll be able to find a list of my skills, projects I have worked on, and work experience. This site pretty much just illustrates my resume in a user-friendly format, but if you'd like to see the document format of my resume, there's a link for that under the resume section. Thanks for visiting, and enjoy your stay!

              UCI OpenCourseWare is a web application that compiles a substantial number of UCI lectures and resources and provides them to the public in the form of video and text. It is the web application I have been working on and maintaining throughout my entire time working at UCI OCW. It runs on the LAMP stack and utilizes the ZendFramework.

              UCI OpenChem is a peer learning application that provides UCI chemistry lectures and resources all in one central hub. It facilitates the communication and interaction between anybody with the desire to learn, by providing a user-friendly live web conferencing interface. Peer learning groups can be established in which a peer leader can provide guidance to other peers on their experiences with certain topics and how to tackle different types of problems. This is one of the biggest applications I have been working on. This application runs on the LAMP stack and uses Laravel5 for its backend and AngularJS for its frontend.

              BooksApp is a startup that I have been working on with one of my friends who graduated from UCI with a degree in business/econ. The application is meant to serve as a central hub for students to buy, sell, and trade their used books. This app will cater to a variety of schools and its core purpose is to allow students to buy/sell/trade their books right on campus, in person. It will facilitate a system that allows the students to easily set up a meeting place and time in order to quickly and efficiently buy/sell/trade books. This application utilizes the MEAN stack.

                This C++ filesystem is a program that allows you to do read/write operations through the command line. It is a direct portrayal of my core programming skills. The filesystem allows you to create files, delete files, and also the ability to leap to a certain part of the text file and begin reading/writing from that position. This was probably one of the more complex projects I've ever had through coursework and thought it would be a good sample for expressing my coding abilities.

          <div class="findingsText">
            <p>My user interviews were pretty straightforward, I just interviewed a few people that I knew would be willing to participate throughout the entire user research and testing process. All of the interviewees have graduated from college, hold degrees from universities, and have jobs. One of them is a data analyst that majored in business/econ and the other two are software engineers that majored in computer science. Most of their answers were straightforward up until I reached the question in which I gave them a scenario about specific applications. In this case, each of them provided answers that varied in technicality and were somewhat correlated to their occupations.

          <div class="findingsText">
            <p>I chose competitors that implemented visuals and functionality that I did not implement in my own portfolio site. I felt like animations were a big eye catcher that I didn’t know how to integrate too well into my own portfolio site, so I chose a competing portfolio site that implemented animations in a very cool way, in the form of an interactive game. The other two competitors I chose were due to the fact that they had very clean user interfaces with consistent themes throughout, this is something that I felt my portfolio site was lacking.

            <p>My feature value matrix was quite simple. The items that would typically be important in a portfolio site, such as navigation, contact, and content ended up being the most valuable. Most of the features I listed in the matrix were rather broad but definitely essential features.

            <p>I felt the user stories were pretty straightforward, they were simply an extension of my feature value matrix. I found that there were only two types of users that would be interested in my portfolio site, which are general users and hiring managers. The general user would subsume the hiring manager role so anything under general user would also apply to hiring manager. Based off of these user stories I discovered how a hiring manager would interact with my portfolio site and what the acceptance criteria would be. Based off of these acceptance criteria I was able to find out the basic amount of implementation needed for certain features in order to satisfy their purpose.

          <div class="findingsText">
            <p>The cognitive walkthroughs were the most useful part of my user testing. I conducted a cognitive walkthrough with three people and each of them provided useful suggestions and pointed out flaws in my portfolio site. Conducting the walkthroughs and recording them was somewhat extensive but definitely paid off. I asked all three participants some of the same questions and found that they would respond the same to simpler questions/tasks but when it came to more convoluted and vague questions/tasks they would respond differently. I also varied some of my questions so that I could elicit different types of information from each of them. One particular interviewee pointed out a big section that I was missing from my portfolio site, which was a section for my education, which may possibly be the biggest finding from my entire user testing and research process.

          <div class="findingsText">
            <p>This was probably the most basic part of my user testing process. I used information that I gathered from the cognitive walkthroughs and made a click test and question test. The click test was used to test what people would click on to open certain projects from my site. Once I looked at the heat maps, there was not much variance. My question test consisted of a few basic questions that asked whether people could determine what the skills part of my site was and what the purpose of the entire site was based off of a single image. I also asked about the user interface and what may be troubling about it. Overall the answers were not very informative or diverse so I felt that this part of the user testing process was the least useful.

        <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>Users found that my site had most of the relevant information for a typical portfolio. Those who answered questions on my user tests gave me all of the answers I had expected. My interviewees and cognitive walkthrough participants also had little trouble in finding out what they were seeking in my portfolio site; however, they did bring many peculiarities and flaws within the site to my attention.
        </p>
        <p>
        Throughout my entire user research and testing process I found several things that I could change in order to enhance my portfolio, especially through my cognitive walkthroughs. Many of them are UI-related but there was one content-related finding in particular that exposed a big flaw in my entire portfolio site, which was my missing “education” section. In terms of the UI, I found that people were somewhat confused as to how to open up my projects in an external link. Also one user found that the big projects button in the middle of my home page turned out to be obsolete. There was also a user that found that the arrow button at the bottom of my home page wasn’t very intuitive either. Another peculiarity that was found was that my contacts page would look as if it is cut off at the very bottom of the page.
        </p>

        <h2> Incorporation of Findings </h2>
        <hr>
        
        <p>My first adjustment to the user interface would be to remove the projects button in the middle of my home page and add it as an option in the navigation menu, possibly replacing the home button and adding a separate absolute-positioned button that would scroll the user all the way back up to the home page if needed. I would next add some text above the bouncing down arrow to indicate that a user should click on the arrow in order to scroll down. In terms of opening each of my projects, I would make the entire rectangle that encloses each project’s information a clickable link that would open up the project in another tab. I would then take the advice of one of my interviewees and add extra content to my contact page so that it takes up an entire viewport. Finally I would implement the education page. </p>
        <p>
        In the incorporation of my findings I was able to do most of the things I had planned to do. I was able to remove the projects button to the navigation bar and ended up replacing the home button with it. I then added an absolute-positioned button to the right side of my site that would only appear after a user scrolled past the home page. I added the text above the bouncing arrow on the home page to clarify its purpose. I also decided to add a few forms to my contact page so that a user could actually send me an e-mail through the forms provided. Unfortunately, I was unable to incorporate a few things I had planned to such as making the entire rectangle a clickable link, this turned out to be a little more convoluted than I had expected because the link wouldn't work and it would ruin the entire styling of the rectangle. Also, I was unable to get to  the education section of my portfolio site. If I were to implement this section I would include all of my achievements and projects I did in school in an appealing format that would have some interaction capabilities. Something that I found my entire site was lacking was a theme or consistent design. Many of my backgrounds are varying and it seems like the entire design is all over the place, I would have to revamp much of my site to do this however, and time is not something that I have right about now. That pretty much wraps up everything related to incorporating my findings.</p>
